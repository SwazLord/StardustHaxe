# Stardust Particles Framework for [Haxe Starling](https://github.com/openfl/starling)

Stardust a fast, extendable particle effect library for Stage3D (it requires Starling as a dependency).

This project is a port of the Stardust Particles Framework from ActionScript 3 to Haxe, specifically for use with the Starling Framework. The Stardust Particles Framework is a powerful and flexible particle system that allows you to create stunning visual effects in your games and applications.

## Features

- **Particle Emitters**: Create particle emitters with various shapes, such as cones, spheres, and rectangles.
- **Particle Renderers**: Render particles using different techniques, including images, meshes, and batched rendering for optimal performance.
- **Particle Modifiers**: Apply modifiers to particles to control their behavior, such as gravity, drag, and color over life.
- **Particle Actions**: Perform actions on particles, such as spawning new particles, emitting sound, or triggering other events.
- **XML Import/Export**: Import and export particle system configurations using XML format.
